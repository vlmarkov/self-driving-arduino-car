# Motion Calibration

## Basic Information
This module responsible to filter peaks of the car motion and transfer C++ structure fields values to pin voltage value for Arduino board.

## Feature
- store history of the previos MotionVector structre values
- filter motion peaks (to make a very smooth motion)
- transfer C++ structure fields values to pin voltage

## Connection Scheme
Connection between RaspberryPi and Arduino is made through simple pin connection.
